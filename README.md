Hi 👋 I'm Amit, a full-time Dotnet Technical Software Engineer 👨‍💻
I'm an experienced software developer with over 16 years of professional working experience. My main area of focus is design and development of software using .NET, but I'm also passionate about learning new technologies, especially Docker, Kubernetes.

I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and skills in programming to create better software. I'm constantly looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, and I'm excited about the challenges that come with staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends.

Feel free to check out my GitHub profile to see some of my work!
